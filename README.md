# Car Damage Classification using SageMaker

Welcome to our end-to-end example of image classification using the Sagemaker 1P image classification algorithm. In this demo, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on imagenet data) to learn to classify a new dataset. In particular, the pre-trained model will be fine-tuned using Car damage dataset.

To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on.
